# ðŸšŠ Rail ID

This is a web-based tool to showcase the [rail-id](https://github.com/Wsiegenthaler/rail-id) parser for UIC rolling stock codes.

A significant portion of the spec has been implemented, but some codes may return incomplete metadata (mainly those containing index letters for non-passenger vehicles).

Check out the [demo](https://wsiegenthaler.github.io/rail-id-web)!
